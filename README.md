# Relational Database for E-commerce Store

I designed and implemented a database that would suit and an online retail business. As part of the project, I developed views to illustrate gross monthly growths/deficits, total returns and profits as well as automated triggers and stored procedures to access specific data and manipulate them i.e. updating and storing customer details or stock size after sales/returns.
Below is the ERD for the project.
